# DemoKin 

:::::::::::::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="60%"}


`DemoKin` uses matrix demographic methods to compute expected (average) kin counts from demographic rates under a range of scenarios and assumptions. The package is an R-language implementation of Caswell [-@caswell_formal_2019; -@caswell_formal_2020; -@caswell_formal_2022], and Caswell and Song [-@caswell_formal_2021]. It draws on previous theoretical development by Goodman, Keyfitz and Pullum [-@goodman_family_1974].

## Installation

Download the stable version [from CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/DemoKin/):

``` {r, eval=FALSE, include = T}
install.packages("DemoKin")
```

Or you can install the development version from GitHub:

``` {r, eval=FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("IvanWilli/DemoKin")
```

## Usage

Consider an average Swedish woman called 'Focal.' For this exercise, we assume a female closed population in which everyone experiences the Swedish 2015 mortality and fertility rates at each age throughout their life; i.e., the 'time-invariant' assumption in Caswell [-@caswell_formal_2019]. 

We then ask:

> What is the expected number of relatives of Focal over her life course?

Let's explore this using the Swedish data already included with `DemoKin`.

```{r, fig.height=6, fig.width=8, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(DemoKin)
swe_surv_2015 <- swe_px[,"2015"]
swe_asfr_2015 <- swe_asfr[,"2015"]
swe_2015 <- kin(p = swe_surv_2015, f = swe_asfr_2015, time_invariant = TRUE)
```

*p* is the survival probability by age from a life table and *f* are the age specific fertility ratios by age (see `?kin` for details). 

Now, we can visualize the implied kin counts (i.e., the average number of living kin) of Focal at age 35 using a network or 'Keyfitz' kinship diagram with the function `plot_diagram`:

```{r, fig.height=6, dpi=1200,fig.width=8, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# We need to reformat the data a little bit
kin_total <- swe_2015$kin_summary
# Keep only data for Focal's age 35
kin_total <- kin_total[kin_total$age_focal == 35 , c("kin", "count_living")]
names(kin_total) <- c("kin", "count")
plot_diagram(kin_total, rounding = 2)
```

Relatives are identified by a unique code:

```{r, fig.height=6, fig.width=8, echo=FALSE}
# kable(DemoKin::demokin_codes[,c("DemoKin", "Labels_2sex")])
kable(DemoKin::demokin_codes[,-c(2)])
```

## Vignette

For more details, including an extension to time-variant rates, deceased kin, and multi-state models in a one-sex framework, see the [Reference_OneSex](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/DemoKin/vignettes/Reference_OneSex.html) vignette; also accessible from DemoKin: `vignette("Reference_OneSex", package = "DemoKin")`. For two-sex models, see the [Reference_TwoSex](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/DemoKin/vignettes/Reference_TwoSex.html) vignette; also accessible from DemoKin: `vignette("Reference_TwoSex", package = "DemoKin")`.
If the vignette does not load, you may need to install the package as `devtools::install_github("IvanWilli/DemoKin", build_vignettes = T)`.
